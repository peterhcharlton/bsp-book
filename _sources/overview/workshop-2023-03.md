# Workshop - March 2023

## Welcome

Welcome to this workshop, which will provide an introduction to the fundamentals of biomedical signal processing and learning for wearable signals of multiple modalities.

### Organisers

This workshop is co-organised by:
- The [Department of Public Health and Primary Care](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge
- [The Alan Turing Institute's 'Meta-learning for multimodal data' Interest Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/meta-learning-multimodal-data)

The workshop was designed and run by researchers from several universities across Europe:
- Kelly Ding, University of Cambridge
- Elisa Mejia-Mejia, City, University of London
- Serena Zanelli, University Sorbonne Paris Nord
- Marton Goda, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology
- Peter Charlton, University of Cambridge

### Outline

This is an interactive, online workshop providing an introduction to the fundamentals of biomedical signal processing and learning for wearable signals of multiple modalities.

The workshop will consist of three parts:
- Participants will be introduced to the signals measured by wearables, including photoplethysmogram and electrocardiogram signals.
- Participants will learn fundamental techniques for processing wearable signals through interactive tutorials.
- Participants will gain hands-on experience of signal processing and machine learning with wearable data through a group exercise, applying data analysis to real-world problems.

The workshop will use pre-prepared teaching materials consisting of online Jupyter notebooks running Python code on the cloud, so no installation is required on participants' computers. The teaching materials are designed to be highly accessible to the non-specialist, while also providing opportunity for people with experience in the field to explore the topic more deeply.

## Schedule

The workshop will last 2 hours.
