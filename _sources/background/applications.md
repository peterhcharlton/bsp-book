# Applications

There are many potential applications for wearable devices in health, fitness and wellbeing contexts. Several applications are discussed in the following publications:

- Charlton PH et al., Wearable Photoplethysmography for Cardiovascular Monitoring. Proceedings of the IEEE. [DOI: 10.1109/JPROC.2022.3149785](https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2022.3149785)
- Charlton PH and Marozas V., Wearable photoplethysmography devices. in Photoplethysmography. [DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-823374-0.00011-6](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/wearable_ppg_chapter/)

Here are some examples which are discussed at length in the above publications. Doubtless there are many more potential applications!
