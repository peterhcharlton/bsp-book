# Code

In this book the wearable data analysis will be performed using Python code. We will use a few existing Python toolboxes in the analysis, which are now described.

## WFDB Toolbox

Waveform Database (WFDB) is a set of file standards designed for reading and storing physiologic signal data, and associated annotations. Data on [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/) are stored in WFDB format.

The WFDB Toolbox is a set of openly-licensed tools for reading, writing, and analysing WFDB data. It is available in [C](https://doi.org/10.13026/gjvw-1m31), [Matlab](https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/matlab/wfdb-swig-matlab/new_version.shtml), and [Python](https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

In this book we will use the [WFDB Python Package](https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a library of tools for reading, writing, and processing physiological signals and annotations.

## Neurokit

[Neurokit](https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/) is a 'Python Toolbox for Neurophysiological Signal Processing'. It includes functions for analysing ECG and PPG signals, such as algorithms for detecting beats in these signals.
