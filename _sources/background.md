# Background

This section presents the background to wearable devices, including:
- [Wearable devices](../background/wearables): An introduction to wearable devices.
- [Signals](../background/signals): The types of signals that wearables acquire.
- [Physiology](../background/physiology): The physiological origins of each signal, and the physiological mechanisms such as pulse arrival time which link signals.
- [Applications](../background/applications): The parameters that can be derived from the signals, and their utility in health and wellbeing applications.
