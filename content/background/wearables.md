# Wearable Devices

Wearable devices present great promise for health monitoring.

## Unobtrusive health monitoring

First, wearables provide opportunity to monitor health unobtrusively. Traditional physiological measurement devices can be obtrusive. Take for instance taking a 12-lead ECG measurement, which is used to assess heart rhythm and conduction:

```

The patient has to attend a health clinic, where a trained operator connects the device using several electrodes and wires.

Consider also traditional blood pressure measurement devices:

```

Even automated blood pressure devices require the individual to wear a cuff, which is inflated for each blood pressure measurement.

Wearable devices provide an alternative approach. They come in a range of form factors, and can monitor health unobtrusively:

Wearable devices can measure an ever-increasing range of physiological parameters:

Consequently, they may be useful for a range of health and fitness applications, including detecting undiagnosed diseases, identifying the early signs of illness, and wellbeing applications:

## Economic health monitoring

Potentially, wearables could provide affordable health monitoring. Whilst I wouldn't necessarily recommend buying the cheapest wearable available, they can cost very little (_e.g._ &#36;2.99 from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fitness+tracker) at the time of writing). Hopefully, in time, high quality wearables could be affordable to most people.

## Empowered health monitoring

Wearables empower individuals to take ownership of their fitness, and potentially modify their lifestyles to improve their health and wellbeing.
