## Cuffless blood pressure 

Estimating blood pressure from physiological signals which can be acquired unobtrusively without the use of a blood pressure cuff. Broadly, there are three approaches for cuffless blood pressure estimation. These are based on the observation that the speed with which the pulse wave propagates increases with blood pressure:
   - measuring the pulse transit time (PTT) between two arterial pulse waves (one closer to the heart and one further away).
   - measuring the pulse arrival time (PAT) between a marker of ventricular contraction, and the arrival of a pulse wave (preferably at a peripheral site)
   - estimating BP from the shape of a pulse wave (such as a photoplethysmography, PPG, pulse wave), since changes in pulse wave velocity and BP influence the shapes of pulse waves.
