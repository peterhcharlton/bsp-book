# Background

This section presents the background to wearable devices, including:
- Wearable devices:
- Signals: The types of signals that wearables acquire.
- Physiology: The physiological origins of each signal, and the physiological mechanisms such as pulse arrival time which link signals.
- Applications: The parameters that can be derived from the signals, and their utility in health and wellbeing applications.
