# Case Studies

This section provides case studies applying signal processing and machine learning to real-world applications for wearables:

1. **[Cuffless blood pressure estimation](../case-studies/bp-estimation-intro)**: Training and testing a model for estimating BP from the PPG
2. **Vascular ageing**: _to be continued_

## Group Work

For the remainder of the workshop we would like you to work together in groups on the case study. We will be on hand to help, and we will ask groups to share their experiences shortly before the end of the session.

### Forming groups

- We recommend groups of between 6 and 8 people
- Please could any coders spread themselves between groups (if you are attending online, then come back to the main zoom room to be allocated to a different group).

### Getting started 

A minimum working example is provided for each case study as a starting point. We have provided suggestions of potential areas of work. Do choose an area (or areas) to work on which suit your skills and interests.

### Sharing experiences

We will ask groups to share their experiences towards the end of the session.
