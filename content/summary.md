# Summary

This book presented an introduction to processing wearable sensor data using signal processing and machine learning.

The book has covered:
- The background to wearable devices, including the signals they measure, the physiology behind the signals, and their applications.
- A practical introduction to wearable sensor data analysis, including data extraction and signal processing.
- Hands-on experience of a real-world problem relating to wearable data, including the opportunity to consider potential use cases, develop and test a data analysis algorithm, and design algorithm assessment methodology.

This book provides only a light introduction to the topic, but hopefully provides you with some key skills and insights on which to build. For further reading on wearables, see:
