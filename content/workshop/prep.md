# Preparation

## In advance

You must be registered for the workshop in order to attend, as it is not included in the standard conference registration. You can register for the workshop at the [IEEE EMBC conference website](https://embc.embs.org/2022/).

Whilst no preparation is required for the workshop, attendees are encouraged to:
1. Familiarise yourself with these resources.
2. Ensure that you can run the tutorials and case study in Google Colabs.
